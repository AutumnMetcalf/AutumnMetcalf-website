        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a first-year political science student at the University of California-Riverside, where I am excited to pursue my passion for understanding and engaging with political systems. My plan is to complete my education with a bachelor's degree in political science, building a strong foundation of knowledge in government systems, administration, and the intricacies of the United States government and its criminal justice and legal system. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable professional experience through various roles. I have worked in the food service industry, where I developed important skills such as adaptability, hard work, and problem-solving. These qualities have proven instrumental in my ability to handle challenging situations and find effective solutions. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work as a soccer coach, where I learned the importance of leadership, teamwork, and communication. Complementing my professional experiences, I have actively sought out opportunities to contribute to my community and expand my knowledge. I have dedicated my time to volunteering for and shadowing lawyers, providing me with firsthand exposure to the legal profession. This experience has further fueled my interest in law and affirmed my desire to pursue a career in this field. <br><br>

        As I progress in my studies, I am eager to continue my personal and professional growth by pursuing internships at law firms, government offices, and non-profit organizations. These internships will allow me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, develop practical skills, and gain a deeper understanding of the social and political platforms that I am passionate about. Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I value my relationships with friends and family. Spending time with them brings me joy and fulfillment, allowing me to recharge and maintain a balanced perspective. Moreover, my diverse range of interests, such as music, concerts, advocacy, cooking, baking, reading, and films, reflect my multifaceted personality and my commitment to being a personable and helpful individual in various settings. Through my experiences as both a student and a professional, I have learned valuable lessons about myself. One aspect that stands out is my adaptability, work ethic, and problem-solving abilities. These qualities have enabled me to navigate diverse environments and overcome challenges effectively. However, I also acknowledge that I can be a perfectionist, which can sometimes pose challenges or be perceived as a negative trait. Nevertheless, I have learned to harness this perfectionism and channel it into ensuring that tasks are completed quickly, efficiently, and accurately.<br><br>

        Furthermore, I have honed my ability to work well both independently and as part of a team. I thrive under pressure and have developed effective time management skills, allowing me to meet deadlines while maintaining high-quality work. These attributes have been cultivated through my experiences as a dedicated student, a volunteer, and a professional, highlighting my commitment to continuous personal and professional growth. In conclusion, as a first-year political science student, I am driven to expand my knowledge and skills in the realm of government systems, administration, and law. With a diverse background in food service, coaching, and volunteering, I bring adaptability, hard work, and problem-solving abilities to my pursuits. I am eager to apply my passion for social and political issues to internships at law firms, government offices, and non-profit organizations. Outside of my studies, I enjoy engaging in various interests and activities, which not only bring me personal fulfillment but also contribute to my ability to connect with others on a personal level.
